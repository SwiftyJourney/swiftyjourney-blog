Hello and welcome to the official **Swifty Journey** blog! üéâ

After much work developing the main Swifty Journey platform, we're excited to launch this completely **redesigned and enhanced blog** with powerful new features! This space is now dedicated exclusively to sharing knowledge, experiences, and the latest news from the Apple ecosystem with unprecedented code highlighting and interactive capabilities.

## What will you find here?

This blog will be your travel companion in the world of iOS development. Here we will share:

### üì± **Practical Tutorials**
From Swift basics to advanced SwiftUI techniques, we'll cover everything you need to become an exceptional iOS developer.

### üõ†Ô∏è **Best Practices**
Learn design patterns, application architectures, and optimization techniques that will help you write cleaner and more efficient code.

### üÜï **News and Updates**
Stay up to date with the latest iOS versions, Xcode, and new APIs that Apple introduces each year.

### üí° **Real Case Studies**
We explore real projects, challenges we've faced, and the solutions we've implemented in application development.

### üéì **Learning Resources**
Recommendations for books, courses, conferences, and tools that we consider essential for any iOS developer.

## ‚ú® **New Blog Features**

We've completely rebuilt our blog platform with cutting-edge technology to provide you with the best reading and coding experience:

### üé® **Enhanced Code Highlighting**
Our blog now features **Shiki-powered syntax highlighting** with dual theme support. Whether you're in light or dark mode, your code will look absolutely perfect:

```swift
import SwiftUI

struct WelcomeView: View {
    @State private var isAnimating = false
    
    var body: some View {
        VStack(spacing: 20) {
            Text("Welcome to SwiftyJourney!")
                .font(.largeTitle)
                .fontWeight(.bold)
                .scaleEffect(isAnimating ? 1.1 : 1.0)
                .animation(.easeInOut(duration: 1.0).repeatForever(autoreverses: true), value: isAnimating)
            
            Button("Start Learning") {
                print("Let's code something amazing!")
            }
            .buttonStyle(.borderedProminent)
        }
        .onAppear {
            isAnimating = true
        }
    }
}
```

### üìã **Advanced Copy Code Functionality**
Every code block features an **intelligent copy system** that includes:
- **Copy button** that appears on hover over the code block
- **Visual feedback** with animated icons (üìÑ ‚Üí ‚úÖ)
- **Automatic language labels** in the top-right corner
- **Legacy browser support** with automatic fallback
- **Temporal feedback** showing "Copied!" for 2 seconds

### üåç **Multilingual Support**
Our blog supports both **English and Spanish** with seamless language switching and properly linked translated articles.

### üì± **Responsive Design**
Perfect reading experience across all devices with our **mobile-first** responsive design that adapts beautifully to any screen size.

### üöÄ **Lightning Fast Performance**
Built with **Astro** for optimal performance, featuring static site generation and minimal JavaScript for blazing-fast load times.

### üéØ **Interactive Components & Specials**
Enhanced with **React and Astro components** for superior learning experience:
- **CodeBlock component**: Code blocks with custom titles
- **Callout components**: Info, warning, tip, and error alerts
- **Copy-to-clipboard components**: Universal copy functionality
- **Language labels**: Automatic programming language tags
- **Interactive demos**: Examples that can run in the browser

### üìñ **Reading Time & Metadata**
Each article displays estimated reading time and comprehensive metadata to help you plan your learning sessions.

## Our Mission

At Swifty Journey we believe that learning should be accessible, practical, and fun. Our goal is to create a community where both beginners and experienced developers can:

- **Learn** new technologies and techniques
- **Share** experiences and knowledge
- **Grow** professionally in the Apple ecosystem
- **Connect** with other passionate developers

## üîß **Supported Languages & Technologies**

Our enhanced code highlighting uses **Shiki** (the same engine as VS Code) and supports 100+ programming languages:

### Primary Languages:
- **Swift** (our specialty! with full iOS APIs support)
- **TypeScript & JavaScript** (including React, Vue, Astro)
- **JSON, YAML, XML** (with syntax validation)
- **HTML, CSS, SCSS** (with rendered hex colors)
- **Bash, Zsh, PowerShell** (with command highlighting)
- **Python, Go, Rust, Java** (complete syntax)
- **Markdown, MDX** (with markup elements)

### Technical Features:
- **Automatic dual themes**: `github-light` and `one-dark-pro`
- **Contextual highlighting**: Variables, functions, keywords
- **Semantic colors**: Different tones for each token type
- **Server-side rendering**: No JavaScript required for basic highlighting

Try our highlighting with this TypeScript example:

```typescript
interface BlogPost {
    title: string;
    content: string;
    publishDate: Date;
    author: {
        name: string;
        avatar: string;
    };
    tags: string[];
}

const createBlogPost = async (post: BlogPost): Promise<void> => {
    try {
        const response = await fetch('/api/posts', {
            method: 'POST',
            headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
            body: JSON.stringify(post)
        });
        
        if (!response.ok) {
            throw new Error(`HTTP error! status: ${response.status}`);
        }
        
        console.log('‚úÖ Blog post created successfully!');
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('‚ùå Failed to create blog post:', error);
    }
};
```
