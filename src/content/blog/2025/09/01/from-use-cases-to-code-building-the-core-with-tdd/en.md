## Introduction

In the [previous](../from-requirements-to-use-cases-building-a-btc-price-app-the-right-way) we transformed vague requirements into **user stories**, **narratives** and **use cases**.
Now it's time to show how those use cases turn into **code**.

But here's the twist: we won't start with networking or persistence. Instead, we'll focus on **the Core** - the heart of the app where contracts and behaviors live. Everything else (infrastructure) will come later.

The goal: **build a modular, reusable, and testable Core using TDD.**

---

## Step 1: Defining the Domain Entities

We start with the essential domain model: `PriceQuote`.
It represents a BTC/USD value at a given timestamp.

```swift
public struct PriceQuote: Equatable, Sendable {
  public let value: Decimal
  public let currency: String
  public let timestamp: Date

  public init(value: Decimal, currency: String, timestamp: Date) {
    self.value = value
    self.currency = currency
    self.timestamp = timestamp
  }
}
```

- `Decimal` gives us precision for financial values.
- `Sendable` ensures safe use across concurrency boundaries.

---

## Step 2 - Contracts: Ports for Data and Persistence

Next, we define the **protocols** (ports).
These contracts describe what the system _needs_ without tying us to specific implementations.

```swift
public protocol PriceLoader: Sendable {
  func loadLatest() async throws -> PriceQuote
}

public protocol PriceStore: Sendable {
  func save(_ quote: PriceQuote) async throws
  func load() async throws -> PriceQuote?
}
```

- `PriceLoader` â†’ how we get the latest price (Binance, CryptoCompare, etc. later).
- `PriceStore` â†’ how we cache the last known value.

Clean Architecture principle: **Define the ports in Core, implement them elsewhere**.

---

## Step 3 - First Use Case: FetchLatestPrice

The simplest behavior: load the latest quote

### Test First

```swift
@Suite("FetchLatestPriceUseCaseTests")
struct FetchLatestPriceUseCaseTests {
  @Test func fetchLatestPrice_deliversValueFromLoader() async throws {
    let expected = PriceQuote(value: 68_901.23, currency: "USD", timestamp: Date())
    let sut = FetchLatestPrice(loader: LoaderStub(result: .success(expected)))
    let received = try await sut.execute()
    #expect(received == expected)
  }

  @Test
  func fetchLatestPrice_propagatesLoaderError() async {
    let sut = FetchLatestPrice(loader: LoaderStub(result: .failure(DummyError.any)))
    await #expect(throws: Error.self) {
      _ = try await sut.execute()
    }
  }
}
```

We start with a happy path and an error path.
These tests **force us** to define the `FetchLatestPrice` use case and a `LoaderStub`.

### Implementation

The use case is trivial: just delegate to the loader.
But the key is: **we only wrote it after the test asked for it**.

---

## Step 4 - Adding Resilience: FetchWithFallback

Requirements said: _use a secondary source if the primary fails_.
So we write tests first:

```swift
@Suite("FetchWithFallbackUseCaseTests")
struct FetchWithFallbackUseCaseTests {
  @Test
  func fetchWithFallback_usesPrimaryOnSuccess() async throws { ... }

  @Test
  func fetchWithFallback_usesFallbackWhenPrimaryFails() async throws { ... }

  @Test
  func fetchWithFallback_throwsWhenBothFail() async throws { ... }
}
```

From these tests we implement `FetchWithFallback`.
Again: tests define behavior â†’ code follows.

---

## Step 5 - Handling Timeouts

But what if a source takes _too long_?
We can't freeze the app waiting. So we add a timeout

### Test with a Fake Clock

```swift
@Suite("FetchWithFallback + Timeout")
struct Test {
  @Test
  func usesPrimary_whenPrimaryFinishesBeforeTimeout() async throws { ... }

  private struct TestClock: Clock {
    func now() -> Date { Date() }
    func sleep(for seconds: TimeInterval) async { /* no-op */ }
  }
}
```

The test uses a `TestClock` that never actually sleeps.
This way we simulate "timeouts" instantly, keeping tests fast.

The implementation runs a race between the primary loader and a timeout task.
If the timeout wins, we fall back to the secondary loader.

---

## Step 6 - Introducing Cache: PriceStore Use Cases

Finally, we define caching behavior.
The `PriceStore` protocol already exists, so we add two simple use cases: `SavePriceToStore` and `LoadPriceFromStore`.

```swift
@Suite("PriceStore UseCases")
struct PriceStoreUseCasesTests {
  @Test
  func saveThenLoad_returnsTheSameQuote() async throws { ... }

  @Test
  func load_onEmptyStore_returnsNil() async throws { ... }

  @Test
  func save_overwritesPreviousValue() async throws { ... }
}
```

The tests use an **InMemoryPriceStore fake**:

```swift
private struct InMemoryPriceStore: PriceStore {
  private var box = Box()
  func save(_ quote: PriceQuote) async throws { box.value = quote }
  func load() async throws -> PriceQuote? { box.value }
  private final class Box: @unchecked Sendable { var value: PriceQuote? }
}
```

This fake store validates the contract without touching disk or databases.

---

## Step 7 - Green Core: All Tests Passing

At this point all our Core tests are âœ… green.
We now have:

- **Entities**: `PriceQuote`
- **Protocols**: `PriceLoader`, `PriceStore`
- **Use Cases**
  - `FetchLatestPrice`
  - `FetchWithFallback` (+ timeout)
  - `SavePriceToStore`/`LoadPriceFromStore`

All behaviors are defined and tested.
And yet: we haven't written a single line of network or persistence code.

That's the power of **driving code from use cases**.

---

## Conclusion

In this article we went from **use case definitions â†’ working Core code**.
We practiced TDD: write a test, watch it fail, implement the minimum, watch it pass.  
And we applied Clean Architecture: the Core defines the contracts, and infrastructure will plug in later.

So far, our BTC/USD app can:

- Load a quote from a loader.
- Fall back to a secondary loader.
- Enforce a timeout
- Save and load cached values.

All modular. All tested. All without IO.

---

## What's Next

In the next article we'll connect the Core with the real world:

- **BTCPriceNetworking** â†’ loaders for Binance and CryptoCompare.
- **BTCPricePersistence** â†’ a concrete store using `UserDefaults` or file storage (we'll see later).
- **BTCPriceFeature** â†’ a ViewModel with a 1-second ticket that saves to cache on success and loads from cache on failure.

Only then will we build the CLI and iOS apps that display the data.
Stay tuned ðŸš€.
